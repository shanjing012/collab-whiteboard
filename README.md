# GET1033 - Exploring Computational Media Literacy
Project Name: Collab-Whiteboard

## Introduction
The purpose of my final project is an online collaborative whiteboard which anyone can draw and edit. I decided on this as my final project as I wanted to learn how to create a fully functional website since we learnt a bit about HTML and CSS in one of our tutorials. I also wanted to create something interactive for the user(s), so that the user(s) can interact with my project! 

## Features
As an online collaborative whiteboard, it includes a few features such as:

* An interactive whiteboard, which the user can draw on
  * Users can freely sketch their thoughts and whatever comes to their mind!
* Multiple users can draw contribute to the whiteboard
  * The whiteboard is collaborative, users can share their thoughts on the same canvas.
* A colour picker, which allows the changing of the brush colour
  * Thanks to Jscolour.js, users can change the brush colour to whatever they fancy.
* Brush size picker, increase or decrease width of the brush
  * Max brush size: 9!
* Various touch devices/browsers are supported
  * Tested with Safari and Chrome browsers!
* Resizing of browser window
  * The canvas will stay at the same aspect ratio! (16:9)
* Download your sketches
  * After drawing together with your friends, you can download the image!
